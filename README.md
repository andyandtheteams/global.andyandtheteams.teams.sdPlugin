# AndyandtheTeams - Stream Deck Microsoft Teams Plug-in Demonstrator

The `AndyandtheTeams - Stream Deck Microsoft Teams Plug-in Demonstrator` was created to prove that Elgatos Stream Decks hardware can be used to start Microsoft Teams chats. It is based on the Elgato `Stream Deck Plugin Template` and requires Stream Deck 4.1 or later.

# Description

`AndyandtheTeams - Stream Deck Microsoft Teams Plug-in Demonstrator` is a plug-in with the following functionality:
- Add Stream Deck buttons for a specific user (email address).
- When a button is clicked, the plug-in opens a Browser URL that forwards instructions to Microsoft Teams and it will start a chat conversation with the specified user. You can quickly create a voice or video call from there as well.

## Limitations of this demonstrator:

This plug-in is not an entirely written code, but I developed it until it was usable for me. If you are interested in supporting this project, please let me know.
Limitations:
- User picture from the global address book needs to be downloaded and added manually (one time task per button)
- The "@" character can not be added to the input field. Please use the predefined one. Any idea why this is the case, please contact me.
- No multi-user group chats.
- Icons do not show the online status of the user
